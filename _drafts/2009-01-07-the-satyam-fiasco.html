Satyam in sanskrit means the truth. What happened with Satyam was completely laughable. <br /><br /><blockquote>Just three months ago, Satyam received a Golden Peacock award from the World Council for Corporate Governance for excellence in corporate governance. And Investor Relations Global Rankings rated Satyam as the company with best corporate governance practices for 2006 and 2007, according to a Satyam press release.</blockquote></div>
