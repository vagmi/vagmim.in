Page 13 of Lisp 1.5 Programmer's Manual provides a half page implementation of Lisp 1.5 in Lisp Meta Language. It is one of the most succinct examples of beautiful code, I have ever seen. I was planning to write a lisp in lisp itself when I remembered about Arc. I started digging into Arc's source to find out its evalquote, eval and apply functions. Here are my findings as I read the arc's source. <br /><br />You start arc by starting as.scm. This calls a function called (tl) with no parameters. (tl) is present in ac.scm. ac.scm contains the implementation of the Arc language</div>
