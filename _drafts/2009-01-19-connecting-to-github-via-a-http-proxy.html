If you have still not heard of <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a>, see this video.<br /><br /><embed src="http://gitcasts.com/flowplayer/FlowPlayerLight.swf?config=%7Bembedded%3Atrue%2CbaseURL%3A%27http%3A%2F%2Fgitcasts%2Ecom%2Fflowplayer%27%2CvideoFile%3A%27http%3A%2F%2Fmedia%2Egitcasts%2Ecom%2Fgit%2Dtalk%2Eflv%27%2CautoBuffering%3Afalse%2CautoPlay%3Afalse%7D" width="620" height="445" scale="noscale" bgcolor="111111" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowFullScreen="true" allowScriptAccess="always" allowNetworking="all" pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer"></embed><br /><br />In summary, Git is...<br /><br /><blockquote>Git is an open source, distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.<br /><br />Every Git clone is a full-fledged repository with complete history and full revision tracking capabilities, not dependent on network access or a central server. Branching and merging are fast and easy to do.</blockquote><br /><br />Git uses two different protocols for pulling and pushing. For pulling, it uses its own git:// protocol or http://. The pulls are quite dumb and are not authenticated. This means that once shared, the repositories are accessible for reads. Push operation is generally implemented using th SSH protocol. This protocol ensures that the communication is not only authenticated but also cryptographically secure. <br /><br />To install git, windows users need to look at the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/">msysGit</a> version. This way you do not have to use Cygwin. This is not the official port of Git for windows but works quite fine. But what I would recommend is to for you to move to linux. I know that it is not possible for every one but its worth it. For saner people running Linux, you can get it from your distributions repository.<br /><br />For Ubuntu, the package named the git-core. There are many <a href="http://git-scm.com/tools">tools and hosting websites</a> that you can work with. However, for hosting, I cannot recommend <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a> enough. GitHub has made source control management cool. I also like them because they are not hostile towards poor folks who are behind http proxies. They have a SSH server running on 443. This means that your corporate enterprise http proxy will think that its a standard SSL server. You can then use <a href="http://www.agroman.net/corkscrew/">corkscrew</a> to tunnel your ssh via http proxy.<br /><br />To get st<br /></div>
