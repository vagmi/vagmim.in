I have been playing around with Haskell for the past week and have found it extremely interesting albeit a little frustrating. I started off with the wrong example. I have started learning every single language by starting off with the customary 'hello world' program. But in case of Haskell, that is the wrong way to start. Trust me!!<br /><br />The program itself is a single line. But you will have to wrap your heads around a concept from Category Theory called a Monad.<br /><br />Code for HelloWorld.hs</div>
