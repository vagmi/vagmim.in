There has been quite some ruckus on the blogosphere about <a href="http://arclanguage.com">Arc</a>. I have just downloaded it and finished reading through the <a href="http://ycombinator.com/arc/tut.txt">tutorial</a>. I like it. I am sure that features like Unicode will get added. However, I would like to see the standard library. How can I do FFI? Database interfaces? May be they are already there but I still don&#8217;t see them yet. In the meanwhile, here is an interesting snipped of Arc for everybody who is pondering about Life, Universe and Everything.<br /><br />arc> (reduce + (cons 6 (map [* 4 _] (keep odd &#8216;(1 2 3 4 5)))))<br />42<br /><br />Keep coding.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_graph">Social Graphs</a> are the rage these days, and for a good reason. My manager, <a href="http://www.ajithprasad.com/">Ajith</a> (<a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/edassery">LinkedIn</a>), commented that he was not entirely sold on the concept of the social graph for the enterprise. Whenever the topic of social graph comes up, people immediately bring <a href="http://www.orkut.com/">Orkut</a> or <a href="http://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a> in their minds. They are social networking applications, which use the social graph as an element of their infrastructure. Enterprises may not need applications like SuperPoke or iLike but they can build much richer applications by using  social graphs as one of its platform services. I would even go to the extent of saying that the social graph is an essential piece of the information infrastructure that IT must provide. This is my bit of free advice for the CIOs.<br /><br />IT always catches up a little later with the management and organization practices. Organizations have been experimenting and implementing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_management">matrix organizational structures</a> for over 20 years. However, every employee table that I&#8217;ve ever seen has only one column for Manager. I wonder what could be the reason for that?<br /><br />Most transnational organizations, prefer matrix structures to promote autonomy and to focus on regional strategies. Furthermore, the advances in IT in the enterprise has enabled managers to have a much wider span and has resulted in considerable reduction in the height of the organizations. When I say height, I mean the number of hierarchical levels in an organization. Organizations in business which demand creativity like software development or advertising, generally are much flatter than the older manufacturing firms following the organizational models created during the Industrial revolution. So the flatter organizations would have culture/values which promote interaction, entrepreneurship and transparency. Unfortunately, today&#8217;s enterprises do not have the requisite IT infrastructure to foster such a knowledge community. Majority of the organizations do not yet have internal blogs or wikis. Even if they do, the level of awareness and the participation is abysmally low.<br /><br />Let us assume a case of  project management in a matrix organization. Every project has a project owner and each project creates a wealth of knowledge for the organization. Most of this information lies as word documents or excel files in a file share. Every developer/engineer working on the project could potentially be reporting to two/more people, his line manager and his functional manager, who would usually be the project sponsor. Further, if the organization employs a 360 degree feedback and appraisal system, we would need to identify his peers in every project that he had ever participated in. The current X.500 based directory servers like Active Directory or NDS provide the tools and infrastructure for a hierarchical organization. This necessitates that the project management system holds information about projects, its members, its sponsor and so on and this system is usually a closed system. Of course, it could provide certain integration possibilities using BAPIs, RFCs or web services but the information about the relationships is essentially in the system.<br /><br />Let us see how the system evolves, if we have the Social Graph as an underlying infrastructure component. The social graph contains information about users, networks and groups. It has restful APIs to perform CRUD operations on each of these. Users can belong to multiple groups but can belong only to one network at a time. The network can be seen as an SBU/LoB or a division providing shared services. All the changes are timestamped and can be undone. This is essential for the integrity of the system. In addition to users, networks and groups, the social graph infrastructure could allow applications to park objects, permissions and authorization information along with the same. Let us visualize how a project management system can be built using this infrastructure alongside couple of other applications.<br /><br />We could have weblog and wiki applications. Weblog application can provide permissions to comment or edit/create a blog to particular user or group. It can even restrict the visibility of the blog to some networks or groups. It can use the ATOM publishing protocol to enable RSS readers and third party authoring applications to integrate. We can do the same for Wiki pages. In fact, the comments module can be a separate application which can be mashed up with both blog objects and wiki page objects. We can then have a profile application, which provides profile pages to users, groups and applications. Profile can have the appropriate information about the group including the details such as the Blogs, Wikis and their corresponding RSS feeds that the user/group would like to expose. We could have RESTful web services exposed on each of these applications.<br /><br />Now the project management system can create groups for each of the project and can add the appropriate members. It can setup a project wiki with the appropriate permission set and setup a project blog and create a profile page of the project. The project management system can now improve collaboration by assigning and tracking work packages.<br /><br />You can observe that you develop small focussed functional modules which can be mashed up easily using the social graphs as the underlying infrastructure. I don&#8217;t mean to say that the social graph is the silver bullet for organization&#8217;s knowledge management issues. But it is about time that we acknowledge that we are trying to shoe-horn a tree when the problem actually mandates a graph.<br /><br />This was supposed to be a mail to Ajith. But I thought it would be better off as a blog entry. Just a way of <a href="http://blog.jonudell.net/2007/04/10/too-busy-to-blog-count-your-keystrokes/">saving keystrokes</a>. :-)</div>

I am a heavy C# and a Python user. I am looking at Java after a long time for some of my projects. I really miss the features in my favorite language. No delegates, no anonymous types, no type inference. In my quest to learn new languages, I started scouring the web. I then came across Scala. It is a better Java for the JVM. According to the <a href="http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/gp4sandbox/benchmark.php?test=all&lang=scala">Alioth performance shootout</a>, Scala&#8217;s performance is comparable to Java6-server&#8217;s performance. It supports type-inference, real iterators, list comprehension, the functional goodness and much more. I am impressed by the ease in which it can use Java&#8217;s libraries. <br /><br />In short, it is a Java that doesn&#8217;t suck.<br /><br />Here are some of the resources that would help you get started with Scala.<br /><br />Scala Home - <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org">http://www.scala-lang.org</a><br />Scala for Java Programmers - part 1 - <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/sundararajan/entry/scala_for_java_programmers">http://blogs.sun.com/sundararajan/entry/scala_for_java_programmers</a><br />Scala for Java Programmers - part 2 - <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/sundararajan/entry/scala_for_java_programmers">http://blogs.sun.com/sundararajan/entry/scala_for_java_programmers</a><br /><br />This is a nice video by the creator of Scala about building component systems and how scala is relevant in this context.<br /><br /><embed style="width:400px; height:326px;" id="VideoPlayback" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://video.google.com/googleplayer.swf?docId=553859542692229789&hl=en" flashvars=""> </embed></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
A while ago, I started dabbling in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming">functional programming</a> space. As with many of my other experiments, I started learning <a href="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Haskell">Haskell</a>. I mentioned this to a couple of friends and they asked me if it had to do anything with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_%28programming_language%29">Pascal</a>. I assured them that they had no resemblance whatsoever. I got off with an excellent <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/YAHT">tutorial</a> on Haskell. But somehow the static typing part had a nagging feeling in the back of my head. I code with C# a lot in my day job. I do not have anything against statically typed languages, but I strongly believe that you can be far more productive with a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system#Dynamic_typing">dynamically typed</a> language.<br /><br />I then came across this <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Write_Yourself_a_Scheme_in_48_Hours">tutorial</a>, which teaches you to write a Scheme interpreter in Haskell in 48 hours. Really Cool. I fell in love with Lisp immediately. I googled for Lisp and I discovered that there are many <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_programming_language#Lisp_today">dialects</a> of Lisp. The most popular ones are <a href="http://www.lisp.org/HyperSpec/FrontMatter/index.html">Common Lisp</a> and <a href="http://www.schemers.org/">Scheme</a>. I decided to go with Common Lisp for some unknown reason. I guess because it had Lisp in its name :-). I then had to find the right implementation for my platform. Being a GNU fan, I picked the <a href="http://clisp.cons.org/">GNU CLISP</a>. As it turns out, it is a horrible implementation which does not support threading and is painfully slow. But it was fine for the small programs that I use for learning. I have <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FeistyFawn">Ubuntu Feisty</a> on my &#8220;home&#8221; laptop but I spend most of my time on the office laptop which as you all might have guessed, runs &#8220;Windows&#8221;. There are many good commercial implementations for Windows but I was looking only for open source software. GNU CLISP seems to be the only fully functional Common Lisp implementation. I&#8217;ve worked with <a href="http://sbcl.sourceforge.net/">SBCL</a> and found that okay too. I did not run into any major issues but their <a href="http://sbcl.sourceforge.net/platform-table.html">website</a> has an yellow status for SBCL on Windows and a big bold notice saying that it is an experimental implementation. But for learning purposes, I guess it is just fine.<br /><br />I followed a really cool <a href="http://gigamonkeys.com/book/">Lisp tutorial</a>, which is actually a book by a guy called <a href="http://gigamonkeys.com/blog/">Peter Seibel</a> named Practical Common Lisp. It is a free online resource.<br /><br />One of my biggest barriers to entry was my text editor. I was a &#8217;<a href="http://www.vim.org/">vi</a>&#8217; guy. As I browsed for help on Lisp, I kept finding these cool <a href="http://common-lisp.net/project/slime/">emacs extensions</a> for lisp programming. I then took the dive and started using <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a>. It was very painful in the beginning. My fingers automatically pressed the <esc> and the &#8216;:&#8217; keys whenever I wanted to do something. But it took about a week of exercise to train my mind to work with Emacs. Writing extensions for vim is a big deal and normal users would not do it. But extending emacs is a piece of cake. It can be done one step at a time and is very well documented. BTW, I am writing this blog on Emacs. One thing VI does not have is the &#8216;longlines-mode&#8217;. If there is one, please let me know. Emacs is just not a text editor but the text editor for me. One more cool thing about using Emacs to code common-lisp is that, you can turn it into a Lisp IDE. <a href="http://common-lisp.net/project/slime/">Slime</a>(a horrible name) is a mode in emacs that turns your modest text editor into a full blown IDE, including code assist and interactive debugging, even on remote machines.<br /><br />So this is your startup kit for learning Lisp.<br /></esc><ul><li>Common Lisp implementation - <a href="http://clisp.cons.org/">CLISP</a> or <a href="http://sbcl.sourceforge.net/">SBCL</a><br /></li><li><a href="http://gigamonkeys.com/book">Lisp Tutorial</a></li><li><a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/"><esc>Emacs</esc></a></li><li><esc><a href="http://common-lisp.net/project/slime/">Slime<br /></a></esc></li></ul>Happy coding!<br /><esc><br /></esc></div>

It would cost you about $10/year. Choose your domain registrar carefully and make sure that the registrar supports a good control panel to change your DNS entries as you wish. Some domain registrars require you to send a mail to them to change your CNAME records. And frankly, that sucks. <a class="reference" href="http://www.nearlyfreespeech.net">NearlyFreeSpeech.Net</a> supports a nice and elegant control panel to manage your domain entries.</p><br /><p>Most blogging sites like <a class="reference" href="http://www.blogger.com">Blogger</a> allow you to host a blog on your own domain. One other thing that you have to do is to get <a class="reference" href="http://www.google.com/a">Google Apps for your domain</a>. That makes setting up email and calendar on custom domains really easy. Google Apps for your domain comes with Google Pages which are static HTML pages. Their page construction tools are not very helpful but some space is better than no space at all.</p><br /></div><br /><div class="section"><br /><h2><a id="cranking-out-your-web-app" name="cranking-out-your-web-app">Cranking out your Web App</a></h2><br /><p>The next thing to do would be to crank out your web application. There are several choices you have. In fact, down right daunting. Since my good friend is a enterprisey kind of guy, let me place this advice right at the beginning.</p><br /><p>Don&#8217;t even try building a serious website with ASP.NET or J2EE. It would take forever and you are tying yourself down to a track facing an oncoming train. Chances of your survival are nearly zero. One of the hassle free solutions which would quickly get messy is to use some Content Management System like PHP Nuke or Post Nuke. This would help you get started very quickly but you cannot do much one you get started.</p><br /><p>Alternatively you can crank your own PHP app with the <a class="reference" href="http://www.railsenvy.com/2007/8/24/rails-vs-php">Ruby on Rails wanna be</a> frameworks like <a class="reference" href="http://www.cakephp.org">Cake</a> or <a class="reference" href="http://www.symfony-project.com">Symfony</a>. I only suggest this because PHP hosting is well supported and easy to setup with a shared hosting partner. <a class="reference" href="http://www.nearlyfreespeech.net">NSFN</a> has some pretty cool plans. Check them out.</p><br /><p>Alternatively, if you are ready to do some hard work, you can create a <a class="reference" href="http://www.rubyonrails.com">Ruby on Rails</a> or a <a class="reference" href="http://www.djangoproject.com">Django</a> based web application. Both these frameworks are pretty good. I am not attempting to start a Ruby or Python war here. I have not hosted Ruby on Rails applications. But the word on the street is that Ruby on Rails deployment is a little more difficult than Python with mod_python. There are camps on either side throwing spit balls at each other. But I would like to refrain from commenting either ways. Look at it this way. Frameworks like RoR, Django, TurboGears (or is it Pylons??) help you achieve tremendous productivity. You will just have to swallow the pill and deal with deployment. Even though I love python and Django, I would have to commend the Ruby on Rails community for keeping change management in mind while designing the framework. You have stuff like Migrations and Capastrino to save several hours of upgrade headaches. I give two thumbs up for Ruby on Rails. :-)</p><br /><p>If you are impressed by Django&#8217;s admin interface capabilities. I would strongly suggest you to look at <a class="reference" href="http://www.streamlinedframework.org/">Streamlined</a>. The amount of code you write to create a fully functional application would be considerably reduced by using these tools with prudence.</p><br /><p>For static content, you must seriously consider <a class="reference" href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3">Amazon&#8217;s Simple Storage Service</a>. It lets you park your static content for a very low fee. You would save tonnes of hassles if your hosting provider pulls you down for exceeding your bandwidth capacity.</p><br /><p>If your target audience is small, I reckon that you might get away with paying about $10-$15 monthly and about $7-$10 yearly for the domain registration.</p><br /><div class="section"><br /><h2><a id="suggestions-for-the-dance-school" name="suggestions-for-the-dance-school">Suggestions for the Dance School</a></h2><br /><p>Now that I have scared you with the options and have left you dazed and confused, let me tell you how I would go about getting the dance studio on the web.</p><br /><ul class="simple"><br /><li>Calendar - Google Calendar (no doubts about it). It has simple and clear <a class="reference" href="http://code.google.com/apis/">API</a> to integrate it with your application.</li><br /><li>Feedback - If the feedback is on particular articles, then you can simply use feedback articles on your blog. Google Calendar also supports comments.</li><br /><li>Static Content - Use google pages or Nearly FreeSpeech.NET&#8217;s hosting. Its pretty cheap and is pay as you use.</li><br /><li>ECommerce - Now you are talking web-apps. I would strongly recommend Ruby on Rails. Throw the hosting question to the community. You will get tonnes of replies. Evaluate them and choose the best. Make sure that you ask the hosting provider about a reference customer so that you could validate your evaluations.</li><br /></ul><br /><p>All the best to you all.</p><br /></div><br /></div><br /></div></div>
