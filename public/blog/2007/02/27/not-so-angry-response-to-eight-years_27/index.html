<div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
I read <a href="http://www.tipsoftheweekonline.com/linuxsucks.html">this</a> (http://www.tipsoftheweekonline.com/linuxsucks.html) and <a href="http://www.tipsoftheweekonline.com/angry.html">this</a> (http://www.tipsoftheweekonline.com/angry.html). First off, I don&#8217;t believe people like rmerrick would have contributed anything of importance to the community. And they are definitely not the kind of geeks using Linux. They are the kind of people who intend to behave like geeks or nerds but end up behaving like jerks.<br /><br />I understand the frustration that you experienced. And I can totally relate to that. But it is really not the fault of Linux. You faced exactly 3 problems<br /><br />1) Monitor detection and configuration<br />2) Unable to play proprietary file formats<br />3) And problems with uninstallation which was due to the proprietary file formats issue. A problem nevertheless.<br /><br />I agree that 1 and 3 are problems. Although the 3rd one does not qualify completely. Have you used synaptic? I always found the <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com">Ubuntu</a>&#8217;s Add/Remove should be replaced with Synaptic Package Manager. But telling that &#8220;Linux&#8221; totally sucks is very misleading. Your comment should instead have been &#8220;Ubuntu sucks for me.&#8221;. I have been using Linux for the past few years and it has its fair share of annoyances. But guess what nothing beats the annoyance of a virus/worm/spyware on a Windows machine.<br /><br />Let me share the incident which prompted me to switch to Linux. Note that I was always an open source fan for its economic reasons and I was okay doing open source on Windows. I am not one of the raving fanboy type of guys. I am not an illiterate computer user either. I&#8217;ve been working on these things since my school days. I always used to log on as restricted user in Windows for the fear that Windows might catch a virus. I diligently updated my antivirus periodically. I keep changing my passwords. I make sure that my Run/Runonce/Startup menu items are clean. I was kind of paranoid about it. But this one day, I got a media player with my korean DVD drive which required administrative access to run. Not to install&#8230; just run. So I used to run that in the adminstrative mode using the RunAs command. Safe - I would presume as this is the only application that runs with the elevated privileges. The player software when closed used to open an instance of IE to check for some stuff.. (for updates I guess) and close it in the background. Unknown to me, IE had somehow got infected and through that my whole system had been compromised. It affected all my executables on my drive. Some of my programs started behaving in a funny manner. I did not notice this until I ran python. The infected executable when run would actually run the virus and would create the actual executable image with a file name of extension .hwd and create a new process. I would have two processes running for each infected executable. The module names for the processes were executable.exe and executable.hwd. Before I knew it, the virus had completely blown away my windows installation. Not one of my executables were sane now. I tried cleaning them but PandaAV was not much help and it got infected. I forgot the name of the virus. :-( Thats when I decided that I would switch to Linux.<br /><br />My initial experience with Fedora Core 4 was horrible. I had to do everything myself. RPM this. RPM that. Broken dependencies and what not. But I had been through hell with Windows which made this a cakewalk. But I ultimately got frustrated with <a href="http://www.redhat.com/fedora/">Fedora</a> and decided to try Ubuntu 5.04. I guess it was called Hoary Hedgehog. The installation was very pleasant and synaptic and apt-get was really cool. I upgraded to breezy after that and haven&#8217;t looked back. So my statement would be &#8220;Fedora sucked for me&#8221; but &#8220;Ubuntu is great for me.&#8221; I had no problem connecting to the universe and multiverse repositories to get the ugly plugins. The folks in the community are quite helpful unlike other communities that I have interacted with. You should probably try a linux distribution like <a href="http://www.linspire.com">Linspire</a>. It is lot more polished than Ubuntu and would definitely solve your virus and worms problem. Linspire has legal codecs to play proprietary formats. You even get the benefit of real customer support. Before dismissing Linux of completely, I would suggest that you have a look at the existing distros, give it a spin and give a fair assessment.<br /><br />I guess, I am really in the mood of ranting this evening.</div>
