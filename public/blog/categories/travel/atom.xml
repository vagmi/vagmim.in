I was reading this blog about <a href="http://www.expatsoftware.com/articles/2008/05/laid-off-one-thing-you-absolutely-need.html">things to do when you are laid off</a>. Although there is is no imminent threat to my job, this is a reality that everybody in the IT industry faces at least once in their career. Even otherwise, taking some time off to travel isn't a bad idea. I was reading this article through the section on the lame reasons why one might not want to travel and I found this.<br /><br /><blockquote><br /><b>But I'm married with a family and a house...</b><br /><br />Ok, you win. You're screwed, but that's the life you chose for yourself so you're going to have to live it. ...<br /></blockquote><br /><br />Ouch!! Thats a pretty hard statement but I digress. I don't mind traveling on a once in a life time trip with my wife even if both of us have to resign to take the time off for six months. I am confident that the IT industry would not change so drastically as to render me unemployable. So when are you guys planning your vacation?</div>
