I have been mulling over learning lisp seriously and using it for real projects. But I never could motivate myself enough to write something worthwhile in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Lisp">Common Lisp</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(programming_language)">Scheme</a>. But after looking at <a href="http://arclanguage.com">Arc</a>, I am impressed. The current version of Arc is written in Scheme. I have been a strong python advocate. But after looking at Arc, I am impressed. Not so much with Arc itself but with Scheme. I was browsing through Arc's code and found that it was surprisingly readable.<br /><br />I am now determined to learn Scheme and contribute to Arc. Maybe, somebody would write a Arc -> Metal compiler but I like the fact that Arc has first been written in Scheme. It is sort of like <a href="http://codespeak.net/pypy/dist/pypy/doc/home.html">PyPy</a> or <a href="http://rubini.us/">Rubinius</a>. But I guess it is a natural thing to do in the Scheme world. I have two more books on my reading list. I have already started with <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/dorai/t-y-scheme/t-y-scheme.html">Teach yourself Scheme in Fixnum days</a> and I plan to grok <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html">SICP</a> as well.<br /><br />Keep coding. You know I am. :-)</div>
