I have been working with <a href="http://radiantcms.org">Radiant</a> for the past couple of days. It is definitely impressive. But I simply hated the fact that you need to work within the confines of the browser's textarea to fill in content. This is just plain lame. I am so used to <a href="http://www.vim.org/">Vim</a> that typing within that small window is just plain irritating. You can of course copy paste stuff from and to vim but that is equally lame. Luckily there are a couple of ways you can work around this. <br /><br />The first being the "<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/4125">Its all Text</a>" extension. Its all text enables me to type anything that I type in a text area in vim. It is actually pretty cool.<br /><br />The second being <a href="http://github.com/nelstrom/radiant-file-system-extension">radiant-file-system-extension</a>. It allows me to use the file system and version content with git. Happy hacking with radiant.</div>
