I am sitting on yet another <a href="http://blog.vagmim.com/2008/11/meetings-and-boredom.html">boring meeting</a> and have written a script to write it to a PDF. Its not a pretty one but I got it done in 30 mins. That has to count for something. You would need <a href="http://www.reportlab.org/">ReportLab</a> and <a href="http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/">PIL</a> for this.<br /><br /><script src="http://gist.github.com/26096.js"></script><br /><br />Beautiful Soup and ReportLab rock.</div>
