<a href="http://www.artha42.com">Artha42</a> is hiring. I have been conducting a lot of interviews lately and am completely dissappointed at the state of freshers coming out of engineering colleges. They spend 4 years supposedly studying IT and Computer Science and cannot answer a simple question like <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000781.html">fizzbuzz</a>. Come on. I completely agree with <a href="http://krishashok.wordpress.com/">krishashok</a> on this one. Chennai does have concentration camps and they are the bane for a creative society.<br /><br /><object width="560" height="340"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/jpDQ66r1f9M&hl=en&fs=1&"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/jpDQ66r1f9M&hl=en&fs=1&" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="560" height="340"></embed></object><br /><br />If there are guys wanting to work in a fun, passionate and challenging environment, please send your profile to careers <at> artha42.com.</div>
