A while ago, I started dabbling in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming">functional programming</a> space. As with many of my other experiments, I started learning <a href="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Haskell">Haskell</a>. I mentioned this to a couple of friends and they asked me if it had to do anything with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_%28programming_language%29">Pascal</a>. I assured them that they had no resemblance whatsoever. I got off with an excellent <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/YAHT">tutorial</a> on Haskell. But somehow the static typing part had a nagging feeling in the back of my head. I code with C# a lot in my day job. I do not have anything against statically typed languages, but I strongly believe that you can be far more productive with a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system#Dynamic_typing">dynamically typed</a> language.<br /><br />I then came across this <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Write_Yourself_a_Scheme_in_48_Hours">tutorial</a>, which teaches you to write a Scheme interpreter in Haskell in 48 hours. Really Cool. I fell in love with Lisp immediately. I googled for Lisp and I discovered that there are many <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_programming_language#Lisp_today">dialects</a> of Lisp. The most popular ones are <a href="http://www.lisp.org/HyperSpec/FrontMatter/index.html">Common Lisp</a> and <a href="http://www.schemers.org/">Scheme</a>. I decided to go with Common Lisp for some unknown reason. I guess because it had Lisp in its name :-). I then had to find the right implementation for my platform. Being a GNU fan, I picked the <a href="http://clisp.cons.org/">GNU CLISP</a>. As it turns out, it is a horrible implementation which does not support threading and is painfully slow. But it was fine for the small programs that I use for learning. I have <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FeistyFawn">Ubuntu Feisty</a> on my "home" laptop but I spend most of my time on the office laptop which as you all might have guessed, runs "Windows". There are many good commercial implementations for Windows but I was looking only for open source software. GNU CLISP seems to be the only fully functional Common Lisp implementation. I've worked with <a href="http://sbcl.sourceforge.net/">SBCL</a> and found that okay too. I did not run into any major issues but their <a href="http://sbcl.sourceforge.net/platform-table.html">website</a> has an yellow status for SBCL on Windows and a big bold notice saying that it is an experimental implementation. But for learning purposes, I guess it is just fine.<br /><br />I followed a really cool <a href="http://gigamonkeys.com/book/">Lisp tutorial</a>, which is actually a book by a guy called <a href="http://gigamonkeys.com/blog/">Peter Seibel</a> named Practical Common Lisp. It is a free online resource.<br /><br />One of my biggest barriers to entry was my text editor. I was a '<a href="http://www.vim.org/">vi</a>' guy. As I browsed for help on Lisp, I kept finding these cool <a href="http://common-lisp.net/project/slime/">emacs extensions</a> for lisp programming. I then took the dive and started using <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a>. It was very painful in the beginning. My fingers automatically pressed the <esc> and the ':' keys whenever I wanted to do something. But it took about a week of exercise to train my mind to work with Emacs. Writing extensions for vim is a big deal and normal users would not do it. But extending emacs is a piece of cake. It can be done one step at a time and is very well documented. BTW, I am writing this blog on Emacs. One thing VI does not have is the 'longlines-mode'. If there is one, please let me know. Emacs is just not a text editor but the text editor for me. One more cool thing about using Emacs to code common-lisp is that, you can turn it into a Lisp IDE. <a href="http://common-lisp.net/project/slime/">Slime</a>(a horrible name) is a mode in emacs that turns your modest text editor into a full blown IDE, including code assist and interactive debugging, even on remote machines.<br /><br />So this is your startup kit for learning Lisp.<br /></esc><ul><li>Common Lisp implementation - <a href="http://clisp.cons.org/">CLISP</a> or <a href="http://sbcl.sourceforge.net/">SBCL</a><br /></li><li><a href="http://gigamonkeys.com/book">Lisp Tutorial</a></li><li><a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/"><esc>Emacs</esc></a></li><li><esc><a href="http://common-lisp.net/project/slime/">Slime<br /></a></esc></li></ul>Happy coding!<br /><esc><br /></esc></div>
