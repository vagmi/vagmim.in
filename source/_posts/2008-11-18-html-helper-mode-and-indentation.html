<div class='post'>
This is my third post for the day. I blogged about <a href="http://blog.vagmim.com/2008/11/meetings-and-boredom.html">this</a> and <a href="http://blog.vagmim.com/2008/11/meetings-and-boredom-continues.html">this</a> earlier today. Writing smaller pieces regularly works much better than waiting for the big post. Commenters, do let me know if you like this style better.<br /><br />I am really irritated with the html-helper-mode's indentation. It flattens the code rather than indenting it. I missed my <a href="http://tidy.sourceforge.net/">tidy</a> command from yesteryears when I did not use emacs. But I am coding on emacs now. I do not have to miss anything from within emacs. So, I added a tidy-html function to format the html as properly indented XHTML. <br /><br /><script src="http://gist.github.com/26161.js"></script><br /><br />And I absolutely love <a href="http://gist.github.com">Gist</a>. It has solved all the quirks involved with posting code on a blog.</div>
