I downloaded <a href="http://www.rubyclr.com/" title="RubyCLR">RubyCLR</a> today to play around with it and found that it was much more productive than <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/Wiki/View.aspx?ProjectName=IronPython" title="IronPython">IronPython</a>. The reason is quite the same as what I mentioned in my <a href="http://installneo.blogspot.com/2006/11/when-cross-platform-is-not-good-enough.html" title="previous blog entry">previous blog entry</a>. The Ruby-CLR bridge, which is essentially a library, is implemented as a native <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/" title="ruby">Ruby</a> extension. So, this gives the developers the choice of using both C based modules and .NET based assemblies from the same script. And thus, in my opinion, RubyCLR is better than <a href="http://jruby.codehaus.org/" title="JRuby">JRuby</a>. We do not have to rewrite most of the native wrappers that are already written. In fact, some of them can be brought to .NET. I am not sure on how to embed Ruby as a scripting language for .NET applications. The other way is pretty clear from the samples that are distributed with the download.<br /><br />Go ahead. Try it out. You will be surprised on how productive you become.</div>
