This blog entry is for relatively novice setup developers and not for the die-hard Windows Installer gurus. Normally different groups in an organization develop components of software, which can be used standalone or as a part of a suite of products. This is a very normal practice. So they go ahead and create a software package with a complete setup.exe and a separate MSI for it. But when they plan to integrate it with the suite. That is when the setup developer's headache starts. The setup developer might be hard pressed for time and would choose nested install of some sort to cut down time. This article discusses a few techniques to handle it in a better fashion.
<br />
<br />Firstly, <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/msi/setup/nested_installation_actions.asp">nested installs</a> are evil. Let me tell you why. They can never be patched and cannot be cleanly removed from the target system. That alone should drive you away from using nested installs. You perform a nested installation. And Boom! The next thing you know is that you have lost control over the life cycle of your application, your house has been burgled and your wife has run away with your neighbor. Well, it was a slight exaggeration but you get the picture. 
<br />
<br />A smarter way to handle this, as many argue would be to call the child install by launching the MSI package's setup.exe or launch msiexec and pass appropriate command line parameters to install the package. This is equally bad. Such installations do not have their rollback logic integrated with the parent installer. Thus if the nested setup fails, you do not have any way to roll back the parent setup reliably or the vice-versa. Furthermore, Windows Installer's architecture allows only one installation at a point to make changes to the system. Having two installations modify system resources might not be the smartest thing to do.
<br />
<br />The only way out of this mess is to use something called as the Merge Module. Merge Module is an atomic unit consisting of components, custom actions and various resources like files and registry entries. These merge modules can be integrated into the main installer at design time by the merge tool. You can either use tools like InstallShield to include merge modules in the application or use WIX's <Merge> tag to include the merge module during build. The advantage of using the merge module is that the components in the merge module remain immutable. Thus it ensures that setup developers follow some of the many important component design rules. A resource going to a location will always have the same component GUID regardless of the product its being installed with. Windows Installer will then be able to do clean refcounting of the components and will give you a solid setup.
<br />
<br />Beyond all this, if the setup were a third party setup, you would have to use the MSI package unless the vendor agrees that you can repackage his setup. Buts lets just assume that he does not. Even in that case, it is recommended that you keep the logic of the third-party setup miles away from your application. You can handle the installation of the third party application from the bootstrapper. There are a couple of applications that do that. <a href="http://www.installshield.com/products/x">InstallShield X Premier and Professional editions</a> have a neat feature called as Setup Prerequisites, which let you call other MSI or non-MSI based installations from the bootstrapper. If you would like to stay open source, then you can use DevAge’s <a href="http://devage.com/dotNetInstaller/dotNetInstaller.html">DotNetInstaller</a> to achieve the same. Both of them are very easy to use. InstallShield’s solution comes with a price tag, sporting a snazzy killer interface and excellent documentation. While the DotNetInstaller is not a setup creation program but is just a bootstrapper and it is free.</div>
