<div class='post'>
There have been a lot of changes with my life lately. The most prominent one of all is that I am single no more. I am now happily wedded to my long time love Shanthi. I stole a few minutes off my busy schedule to post this <wink/>.<br /><br />I am going drop off the web for a couple of weeks now. Bye Bye web. Cya later.</div>
