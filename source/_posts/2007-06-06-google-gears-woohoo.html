If you have not heard about <a href="http://gears.google.com/">Google Gears</a> yet, check their homepage first. And in the very web way of getting excited, you can view a video presentation of Google Gears <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQyha30nm6k">here</a>.<br /><br /><object height="350" width="425"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/cQyha30nm6k"><param name="wmode" value="transparent"><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/cQyha30nm6k" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" wmode="transparent" height="350" width="425"></embed></object><br /><br />There are other projects that are coming up on Google Code hosting related to Google gears. One of the more interesting ones is <a href="http://code.google.com/p/gears-dblib/">gears-dblib</a>. You have other pointless projects like <a href="http://code.google.com/p/tuiki/">Tuiki</a>. Nevertheless, it is good to get you up and running with Gears. Have fun coding. :-)</div>
