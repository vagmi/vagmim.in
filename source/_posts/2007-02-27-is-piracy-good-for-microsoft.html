<rant><br />I was watching this <a href="http://www.crankygeeks.com/2007/02/cranky_geeks_episode_50_rsa_co.html">video</a> on <a href="http://www.crankygeeks.com/">Cranky Geeks</a> and they were talking about Romania and piracy. The story is covered <a href="http://www.vnunet.com/vnunet/news/2174068/piracy-helped-gates-told">here</a>.<br /><blockquote><br /><p>"Software piracy has many negative economic consequences, such as local software industries being crippled by competition with pirated software from abroad, and lost tax revenues and jobs from the lack of a legitimate market," said the BSA report.</p>  <p>"These costs reverberate up and down the supply and distribution chains." </p></blockquote><p></p><br /><br />I was not surprised. I find this it was extremely immature and stupid on the part of the government. I am from India and I can relate to this. The government and people here are equally immature and stupid. I believe that we are painting ourselves into a corner. What appalls me is the ease in which we can get pirated software vis-a-vis their open source counterparts. We can get pirated software from friends, or a walk on SP Road or any of the PC assemblers. But to get the latest versions of open source software and its documentation in terms of books is an extremely costly affair. If you don't believe me visit Gangarams or <a href="http://www.sapnaonline.com">Sapna Book house</a> and look at the price of linux distros there. I do not believe that technical superiority is responsible for the liberal presence of Windows operating system in Indian homes. It is due to its easy availability of pirated software. System assemblers know Windows better than Linux. The people who get it buy computers for browsing, surfing, watching movies and playing games. And not to mention the uncles and aunties fiddling with worthless astrology software that runs only on DOS (yes! you heard me. DOS!!!) and Windows. Probably we must make such astrology software for Linux and make it available on Live CDs for all these maamas and maamis to try it out.<br /><br />I have some friends who are Indians living in India and yet buy Windows XP Home licenses. Can you believe that? They definitely are the minority.  They are statistically insignificant. And some of them do have a Ubuntu installation safely tucked into one of their partitions. They were actually sold on the fact that Microsoft can actually track you down and sue you for using pirated versions of their software. But when that does happen, then the whole country has to be worried. <a href="http://www.irctc.co.in">IRCTC's website</a> does not work well with Firefox. I book my tickets most of the time with IRCTC. Indian airlines' website does not work well with firefox. <a href="http://www.icicibank.com">ICICI's website</a> has just started working with Firefox. We are actually glued on to windows. I cannot find a single indian music site which works on flash audio like <a href="http://www.odeo.com">www.odeo.com</a> or <a href="http://www.pandora.com">www.pandora.com</a>. My favorite is <a href="http://www.musicindiaonline.com">www.musicindiaonline.com</a>, which hosts an ActiveX control. I am not against Microsoft but I believe that it is not an economically viable alternative for us as a nation. I strongly believe that India is better off with open source software. <a href="http://www.winehq.com/">Wine</a> is not the solution. It will only worsen the situation. What we need is cross platform applications.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.microsoft.com">Microsoft</a> will not bother about piracy in India as it is generating a huge talent pool and establishing a base of future customers. These customers are already trained on Microsoft software. So the organizations that hire them run Windows. Even the Java schools have a starter program for the computer illiterates and they start of with Microsoft Office, Internet Explorer and Outlook Express. Why don't they start of with <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com">Ubuntu</a> or Linspire? Why dont they teach them the Google life. I am not against Microsoft or Windows. I am against the fact that we think it is smart on our part to pirate software and use it while all we are doing is increasing the liability on our employers and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_Inc">India Inc.</a>, as a whole. Open source software can solve most of these problems. With increased broadband penetration and web increasingly becoming a platform, we must get away from IE and ActiveX as far as possible have cross platform technology solutions.<br /><br />Both Windows and Linux have their advantages and disadvantages depending on the kind of applications that you try to run. I feel Linux is better for me. It has been over 2 years since I switched to Linux as my primary operating system and I have never looked back. I wish others could see this in the same light as I do.<br /></rant></div>
