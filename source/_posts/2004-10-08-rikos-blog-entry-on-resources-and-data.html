Imagine a blog entry where Riko speaks on the Resources, User Data and Application Data. As noted in his blog, he is yet to make his point. <smile/> It is an excellent blog entry. Also read Rob's entry on what <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/robmen/archive/2003/09/29/56470.aspx">setup is</a>. There are a couple of links to the same entry in Riko's article too.</div>
