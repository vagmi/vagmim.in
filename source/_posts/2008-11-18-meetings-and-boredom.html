I am sitting in a really boring meeting. I was browsing reddit and found a very interesting dilbert script. I am a huge fan of Dilbert and wanted to download Dilbert strips for offline viewing. I know its not entirely ethical but what the hell. I wrote a small python screen scraper to do that. This requires you to download <a href="http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/">Beautiful Soup</a>. If I am too bored, I will write a script to compose it as a PDF.<br /><br /><script src="http://gist.github.com/26089.js"></script></div>
