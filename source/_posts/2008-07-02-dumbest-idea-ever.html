I just came across this product called <a href="http://www.programeter.com/">Programeter</a>. There are only two possible market segments for this product. <br /><ul><br /><li>Managers who have no friggin' clue of what programming is</li><br /><li><b>PLAIN DUMB FUCKING IDOTS</b>.</li><br /></ul><br />Now that I have got your attention, lets move on. This is what is displayed as their sales pitch. Look at the first item on the list. <br /><br /><blockquote><br /><ul><br /><li>Companies have merged and you need to decide what 15% of programmers to let go?</li><br /><li>Your consultancy firm needs an estimation report of your client's programmers  next week?</li><br /><li>Need to double check your team leader reports by actual data?</li><br /><li>You are a newly assigned project leader and NEED to know what's going on in your team?</li><br /></ul><br /></blockquote><br /><br />Most companies should already know this. Any productivity measurement for a programmer can be cheated. If you have made a mistake in your recruitment, its already too late. There is no way around it. So stop recruiting people by the truckload. Look for good people with all round skills. Learning a new language or a technology platform is not difficult for a good engineer. Unfortunately, the entire Indian HR recruiting industry does a little more than keyword match to select potential candidates. Every HR Manager working in a software company must read "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Smart-Gets-Things-Done-Technical/dp/1590598385">Smart and Gets things done</a>".<br /><br />If you already have the wrong people on board long enough, you are doomed. And one way of knowing that you have a wrong person long enough is to ask your middle management on their views of using Programeter. If they give a glowing recommendation of the product, <a href="http://www.testearly.com/2007/08/17/fire-your-best-peoplereward-the-lazy-ones/">fire them</a>.</div>
