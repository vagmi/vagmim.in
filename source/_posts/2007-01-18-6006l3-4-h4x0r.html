I just came across <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/xx-hacker/">this</a>.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1337_5p34k">1337 5p34k</a> is a form of hacker language that was very popular on BBSes in the good old days. I did this in my college days. I was pleasantly surprised to find this page on Google. :-)</div>
