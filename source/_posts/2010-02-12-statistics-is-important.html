This is important.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.google.co.in/search?q=population+of+india&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=com.ubuntu:en-US:official&client=firefox-a"><br />The population of india</a> - 1.148 Billion<br /><a href="http://www.google.co.in/search?q=indian+population+growth+rate&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=com.ubuntu:en-US:official&client=firefox-a">The population growth rate</a> - 1.58%<br />Number of people that will be added this year - 1.8 Million<br /><a href="http://www.google.co.in/search?q=population+of+chennai&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=com.ubuntu:en-US:official&client=firefox-a">Population of chennai</a> - 4.34 Mio<br /><br />So we will add almost half of chennai in the next year. In this rate, the number of years it will take for us to double our population is approximately 45 years. Think about it. Do you really want to have children? We do not have enough resources to feed the entire country at this point.</div>
