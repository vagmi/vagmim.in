I am a heavy C# and a Python user. I am looking at Java after a long time for some of my projects. I really miss the features in my favorite language. No delegates, no anonymous types, no type inference. In my quest to learn new languages, I started scouring the web. I then came across Scala. It is a better Java for the JVM. According to the <a href="http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/gp4sandbox/benchmark.php?test=all&lang=scala">Alioth performance shootout</a>, Scala's performance is comparable to Java6-server's performance. It supports type-inference, real iterators, list comprehension, the functional goodness and much more. I am impressed by the ease in which it can use Java's libraries. <br /><br />In short, it is a Java that doesn't suck.<br /><br />Here are some of the resources that would help you get started with Scala.<br /><br />Scala Home - <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org">http://www.scala-lang.org</a><br />Scala for Java Programmers - part 1 - <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/sundararajan/entry/scala_for_java_programmers">http://blogs.sun.com/sundararajan/entry/scala_for_java_programmers</a><br />Scala for Java Programmers - part 2 - <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/sundararajan/entry/scala_for_java_programmers">http://blogs.sun.com/sundararajan/entry/scala_for_java_programmers</a><br /><br />This is a nice video by the creator of Scala about building component systems and how scala is relevant in this context.<br /><br /><embed style="width:400px; height:326px;" id="VideoPlayback" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" src="http://video.google.com/googleplayer.swf?docId=553859542692229789&hl=en" flashvars=""> </embed></div>
