It is sometimes very useful to know the git branch you are working on right from the command prompt. You can do this by editing the ~/.bashrc file.<br /><br /><script src="http://gist.github.com/103674.js"></script><br /><br />This will show up a prompt which looks like this and fails gracefully when you are not on a git repo.<br /><br /><pre><code><br />vagmi@deepthought:~/work/testproj[master]$ git checkout new_feature<br />Switched to branch "new_feature"<br />vagmi@deepthought:~/work/testproj[new_feature]$ cd ..<br />vagmi@deepthought:~/work$<br /></code></pre><br /><br />This saves a lot of "git branch" when you are coding.</div>
