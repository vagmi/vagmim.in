There has been quite some ruckus on the blogosphere about <a href="http://arclanguage.com">Arc</a>. I have just downloaded it and finished reading through the <a href="http://ycombinator.com/arc/tut.txt">tutorial</a>. I like it. I am sure that features like Unicode will get added. However, I would like to see the standard library. How can I do FFI? Database interfaces? May be they are already there but I still don't see them yet. In the meanwhile, here is an interesting snipped of Arc for everybody who is pondering about Life, Universe and Everything.<br /><br />arc> (reduce + (cons 6 (map [* 4 _] (keep odd '(1 2 3 4 5)))))<br />42<br /><br />Keep coding.</div>
